# Fuzzy C-means (FCM) Clustering simulator

This project was made for educational purpose, to show how the Fuzzy C-means Clustering algorithm work.

The project was bootstrapped with create-sveltekit-eel-app, which makes use of two technologies:
- Eel: A Python library for ["making simple Electron-like offline HTML/JS GUI apps."](https://github.com/python-eel/Eel)
- SvelteKit: ["A framework for rapidly developing robust, performant web applications using Svelte"](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/introduction)
  - SvelteKit will be running in SPA mode.

### Quickstart
Before development, install required dependencies for both front-end and Python back-end

```
npm i
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Then run the app with

```
npm run start:eel
```

The app will be started as an desktop offline app, similar to apps made with Electron.
